# Extras

## Earflap

Provisional connector to attach a [60x60x25 mm, 24 V DC fan](https://www.amazon.fr/Ventilateur-60x60x25mm-22dBA-Sunon-MF60252V21000UA99/dp/B07ZBSBP33/) to Upkie's head. Helps avoid thermal throttling when the robot actively balances for more than one hour.

## Handle

Regular handle to grab the robot and move it around.

## Switch support

Small support to screw on the side of the robot to hold the on/off power switch and make it easy to access.
