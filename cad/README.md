# CAD

Source files in this directory can be used to adapt parts to your own design. There are two types of CAD files:

- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (``.blend``) files: those are mainly for parts that were adapted from the [mjbots quad](https://github.com/mjbots/quad/tree/42bbbffb694560cd855d12f6a6930ce2af3cbc5a/hw/chassis/3dprint).
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) (``.FCStd``) files: those are the more recent parts.

In the future new parts will be designed in FreeCAD, while legacy parts are in Blender format.
