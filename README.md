# Parts for Upkie

- [3D printing](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie_parts/tree/main/3d_printing): 3MF and STL files
- [CAD files](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie_parts/tree/main/cad): Blender and FreeCAD projects

We maintain these files here so that end users don't need to clone the full part revision history with the main [upkie](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie) repository.
