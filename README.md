# Parts for Upkie

We maintain 3D-printed part files in this separate repository so that only part designers have to clone their full revision history (most users will only need to clone the main [upkie](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie) repository).

- [3D printing](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie_parts/tree/main/3d_printing): 3MF and STL files
- [CAD files](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie_parts/tree/main/cad): Blender and FreeCAD projects
