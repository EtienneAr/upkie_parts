# 3D printed parts for Upkie

This repository provides [3D printing](https://github.com/upkie/upkie_parts/tree/main/3d_printing) (3MF and STL files), [CAD files](https://github.com/upkie/upkie_parts/tree/main/cad) (Blender, FreeCAD) and Markdown files to keep track of part history.

> [!NOTE]\
> We maintain parts in this separate repository because their full revision history is quite memory-consuming. Only part designers should have to clone this repository; most users will only clone the main [upkie](https://github.com/upkie/upkie) repository.
