# 3D printed parts for Upkie

We maintain parts in this separate repository because their full revision history is quite memory-consuming. Only part designers should have to clone this repository; most users will only clone the main [upkie](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie) repository.

## In this repository

- [3D printing](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie_parts/tree/main/3d_printing): 3MF and STL files
- [CAD files](https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie_parts/tree/main/cad): Blender, FreeCAD and Markdown files
